title: "Predictability in Music"
---

As a student of Western classical music and as a music-lover in general, I enjoy
music of all sorts, from various time periods. Over the many hours I have spent
listening to music, I have observed a peculiar trend in the predictability of
music composed in different time periods. This post is aimed at describing the
same.

For the purpose of this post, we define 'predictability' as the ease of
prediction of a piece of music given a small part of it. Although it is a fairly
loose and relative definition, it should suffice for this post.

Our journey begins in early 18th century Germany, where the music of Johann
Sebastian Bach was all the rage. The music of Bach (what is now known as
'Baroque' music) is characterised by its complex, yet highly predictable
character. Baroque music generally consists of multiple voices (either played by
various instruments, or sung) which play/sing in harmony. In most pieces of this
era, there is a fairly strict relationship between what the voices sing. Thus,
given what a certain voice sings, the other voices can be preicted quite easily.
This near-mathematical predictability of Baroque music was further illustrated
by Bach in his 10 "puzzle canons", which were pieces which were written only
partially by the composer, the completion of the canon being left as a puzzle to
the readers (check out [this page](http://www.schillerinstitut.dk/moweb/part3intro.htm)).

We now proceed from early 18th century Germany to late 18th century Austria: the
place of residence of Mozart, Haydn, and later on, of Beethoven. The music of
this time (the Classical era) had gradually branched off the Baroque format of
polyphonic harmony to a 'melody-and-accompaniment' style, where one voice sings
the melody and the others give supporting accompaniment. Although this is less
rigid than the Baroque style, the music stuck to a fairly strict 'form' (a
format in which the music progresses). As the Classical era progressed,
composers started straying away from the form, and thus the predictability of
music gradually decreased.

After the Classical era came the Romantic and Post-Romantic eras. This was, in
my opinion, the peak of unpredictability in music. This music contained all sorts
of crazy modulations and progressions which were never seen before in the
Classical or Baroque eras. Some examples of highly unpredictable music are the
pieces of Frederic Chopin (a Romantic composer) and Calude Debussy (a Post-Romantic
composer).

We now come to the 20th century, the rise of the Pop and Rock genres.
Suddenly, we see a sharp drop in unpredictability. For reasons unknown, the
majority of music composed since then has been essentially the same. This was
famously demonstrated by the [Axis of Awesome](https://www.youtube.com/user/axisofawesome)
in their ['Four Chords'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ),
a compilation of more than 40 songs, all of which utilize the same chord
progression. It is not just chord progressions, but also melodies that have been
reused again and again over the years. I highly encourage you to checkout
soundsjustlike.com which demonstrates similarities in pairs of popular songs.
Why is it that out of all the different possibile melodies that could be
created, only a few are being reused repeatedly? It seems that we humans have
started to gravitate to a select few melodies and chord progressions which seem
to 'work'. Will this trend continue? Or will we, at some point in time, get
'bored' of the same, predictable music being produced again and again with
different lyrics? Will the music produced a few centures later still be the
same, or will we see something different and unpredictable?
