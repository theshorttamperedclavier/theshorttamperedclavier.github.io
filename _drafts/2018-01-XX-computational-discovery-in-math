title: "Computational discovery in math"
---

(Background: In this post, the author discusses topics from a seminar
on math and computer science, the details of which are given at the end.)

In the recent past, we have seen exponential progress in computing
capacity, which is predicted to continue until we reach the quantum
mechanical constraints which govern how transistors work. More specifically,
<...>'s law states that the computational power will get doubled every <...>
years. With this increase, we have, of course, been able to come up with some
brilliant appliications. Isn't it wonderful that your email gets sent a few
milliseconds faster? Wouldn't you be willing to do just about anything to make
that trivial, addictive game load faster, even if by just a couple of seconds? /s
Wouldn't you want to be able to finally make W*ndows boot up in reasonable time?
(Long shot, but worth a try.)
With fractional increases in computing power, tech companies are extracting hundreds
of Dollars more from misinformed users, who are convinced of this need of theirs, 
or driven by a greed of better computing power.

Jokes apart, aside from the usual user who finds this computing power useful, if
not absolutely essential, there is another tribe of people who see another use for it.
The tribe of symbol-manipulating illusionists promising that it'll all be useful one day
-- of course, mathematicians. Sure, we will have people who'll pull out a giant cigar,
comfortably rest by the fireplace, pull out a pocket-sized notebooks with statements
saying "Back in my day we did proofs in margins if they were small enough to fit".
Back in the day, it was, indeed, the only possible way, and remains absolutely essential
even today, for it makes man{^1} trace the well-[ENDDRAFTTEXT]
