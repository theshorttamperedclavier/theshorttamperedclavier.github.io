**Aalok Sathe**

**Mandar Juvekar** I'm a 12th grade student in Pune, India. My interests include
mathematics, computer science, and Western and Indian classical music. I am a
Google Code-In top 10 contributor for the
[MovingBlocks](https://github.com/MovingBlocks) open source organization
and have been actively involved in their [Terasology](http://terasology.org)
project since then. I am currently working as a mentor for the organization for
the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) competition. I
have been training as a classical pianist for 6 years, and have passed the
Trinity College of London's piano exams up to grade 5 with distinction. I can
also play the tabla, and have been receiving informal education in Hindustani
classical music from Shardul.

**Shardul Chiplunkar** I'm a high-school senior originally from Pune, India, and
currently in Fremont, CA. My interests include mathematics, computer science,
linguistics, and both Hindustani/North Indian and Western classical music. I've
done a fair bit of competitive mathematics, not too succussfully; I am a Google
Code-In Grand Prize Winner for my work with Apertium, an open source machine
translation platform; I've been on Team India for the 14th International
Linguistics Olympiad (and will be on it for the 15th in a few weeks); and I have
been training as a Hindustani classical vocalist for 10 years, and receiving an
informal education in Western classical music from Mandar.
