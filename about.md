**Aalok Sathe**

**Mandar Juvekar** I'm a 12th grade student in Pune, India. My interests include
mathematics, computer science, and Western and Indian classical music. I am a
Google Code-In top 10 contributor for the
[MovingBlocks](https://github.com/MovingBlocks) open source organization
and have been actively involved in their [Terasology](http://terasology.org)
project since then. I am currently working as a mentor for the organization for
the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) competition. I
have been training as a classical pianist for 6 years, and have passed the
Trinity College of London's piano exams up to grade 5 with distinction. I can
also play the tabla, and have been receiving informal education in Hindustani
classical music from Shardul.

**Shardul Chiplunkar** I'm a high-school senior originally from Pune, India, and
currently in Fremont, CA. My interests include mathematics, computer science,
linguistics, and both Hindustani/North Indian and Western classical music. I've
done a fair bit of competitive mathematics, not too succussfully; I am a
[Google Code-In Grand Prize Winner](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/01/announcing-google-code-in-2016-winners.html)
for my work with [Apertium](https://www.apertium.org/), an open source machine
translation platform; I've been on Team India for the
[14th International Linguistics Olympiad](http://iol14.plo-in.org/)
with Aalok as a senior teammate (and I will be on the team for the
[15th](http://www.iol2017.ie/) in a few weeks); I have been training as a
Hindustani classical vocalist for 10 years and have rudimentary tabla and
harmonium skills; and I have been receiving an informal education in Western
classical music from Mandar.
