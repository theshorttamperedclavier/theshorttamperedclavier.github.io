<div class="about-author">Aalok Sathe</div> I am a student at the
[University of Richmond, VA](http://richmond.edu). I'm a computer science
major and might end up also majoring in cognitive science or math.
I also study linguistics.
I'm interested in math, machines, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience,
football (soccer) and music (in no particular order), among other things. I'm a
FOSS enthusiast. I have undergone training in Indian classical music as a
vocalist, and have been learning Western voice at UR, where I also sing in the
University mixed choir.
I find organization within nature, and systems of all kinds, fascinating -- the
complex human brain, computers, human society, the universe, to name a few.

<div class="about-author">Mandar Juvekar</div> I'm a rising sophomore at the [University of Rochester](http://rochester.edu)
majoring in computer science and mathematics. My interests (as of June '19) lie in
theoretical computer science, abstract algebra, mathematical logic, and formal semantics in artificial
intelligence. I am currently working as a research assistant in a group focused
on logical systems for natural language unerstanding, and am doing some
independent mentored math research. I am also very interested in music,
especially Western classical music, and have been training as a classical pianist
for over 9 years. During the school semesters I'm taking piano lessons at the
Eastman School of Music and am part of the University's chamber ensemble
program. Apart from this I'm also a fairly active member of the Terasology
Foundation, an open-source game development organization. For more, you can

<div class="about-author">Shardul Chiplunkar</div> I'm an MIT '22 undergrad from Pune, India, but also from
the Bay Area, California. My academic interests are somewhere in the
neighborhood of math, computer science, linguistics, and cognitive science,
somewhere that I don't yet have a good word for! My favorite description so far
is that I want to study how intelligence arises and functions, whether it be
physically in a human brain, virtually in an artificial intelligence, or
formally in a mathematical system. Apart from that, I enjoy Hindustani classical
music, typesetting with LaTeX, playing table tennis, science fiction, teaching
math, and thoughtful discussions. I've been involved with music in various
forms, including Hindustani classical vocal training, choir and a cappella,
basic exposure to *tabla* and guitar, and experience with sound production and
engineering. You can check out [my homepage](https://www.mit.edu/~shardulc/) for
more.

<div class="about-author">Rujul Gandhi</div> I'm a sophomore at MIT
majoring in linguistics and EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science). Biology is another of my academic interests. In non-academic interests, I am involved in classical dance, [journalism](https://thetech.com/authors/rujul-gandhi), and the [MIT Educational Studies Program](esp.mit.edu), among other things. I also like to hike and write.
