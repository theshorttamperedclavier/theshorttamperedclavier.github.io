**Aalok Sathe**

**Mandar Juvekar**

**Shardul Chiplunkar** I'm a high-school senior originally from Pune, India, and
currently in Fremont, CA. My interests include mathematics, computer science,
linguistics, and both Hindustani/North Indian and Western classical music. I've
done a fair bit of competitive mathematics, not too succussfully; I am a Google
Code-In Grand Prize Winner for my work with Apertium, an open source machine
translation platform; I've been on Team India for the 14th International
Linguistics Olympiad (and will be on it for the 15th in a few weeks); and I have
been training as a Hindustani classical vocalist for 10 years, and receiving an
informal education in Western classical music from Mandar.
