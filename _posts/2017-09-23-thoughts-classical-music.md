Note: The *Sāmaveda* is actually from around 1200 to 1000 BCE. It's a collection
of religious and philosophical chants and musical compositions, setting a lot of
verses from the earlier *[Ṛgveda][17]* to music according to poetic meter and other
"mathematical" music considerations as Mandar mentions. *Dhrupad* is a style of
Indian classical music, distinct from Hindustani classical ("HCM") and Carnatic
classical.

What is this mathematical music? Much can be said about it, but we'll try to
explain with the example of baroque canons. In the [Baroque][4] period (1600--1750),
a form of music called the *[canon][18]* came to popularity. A canon consists of multiple
voices which are played simultaneously. It starts with one voice "stating" a
melody, followed by the other voices joining in. The speciality of a canon is that
what each voice plays is a precise derivative of the melody. These derivates can
be formed by applying to the melody one or more of a few allowed transformations
(for example shift in scale, shift in rhythm, inversions, etc). In fact, these
canons are so precise and "calculated" that during the Baroque era it was a common
pass-time to compose and exchange "puzzle canons", where parts of the canon are
left blank for the reader/performer to fill in. The beauty is in writing canons
where the voices harmonize with each other perfectly. J. S. Bach was a master of
balancing voices, as is seen in his [Musical Offering][3], a collection of puzzle
canons, fugues, and more.

An example from HCM is in *tāna*s, or extended sequences of notes sung very
rapidly but with precision, typically around 8 or 9 per second. Here, patterns
of notes, e.g. '1-2-3-4-2-3' where '1', '2', '3', '4' are adjacent notes in a
*rāga*, are repeated with shifts in pitch (not absolutely, but relative to the
available pitches in the *rāga*), combined into meta-patterns, and morphed into
other patterns, all while improvising at 8 or 9 notes *per second*.

Playing around with these various dimensions of music---time, tempo, relative
pitch, abstractions within music, etc.---to create appealing patterns is what
"mathematical" music is all about. For a Bach-focused, multidisciplinary, and
thoroughly enjoyable overview of the topic, *[Gödel, Escher, Bach][5]* by
[Doug][6]las [Hof][7]stadter is recommended reading (in fact it is recommended
reading for the rest of this post and for life in general).

"Base framework" above refers to the general structure of an HCM performance.
There are set rules for a *rāga*,
concerning which notes can be used and in what contexts, but these can be bent
by skilled performers as long as the changes sound nice and do not stray too far
from the original or for too long. Further, there is a set flow to a performance:
first a slow-paced, elaborate *khyāl* with a focus on developing the mood of the
*raga*, followed by a moderate-paced composition (often the same *khyāl* but more
peppily) with more playful variations on tempo, then a fast-paced piece or two
for *tāna*s and any unconventional ideas the performer has, and finally, in
modern times, semi-classical or light music, like devotionals.

WCM has a different sort of "base framework". Western pieces of music are generally
much more free to change keys and tempo in the middle, unlike HCM, as scales are
more 'lightweight' than *rāga*s are and serve a slightly different purpose (as
discussed later in this post).
The framework, in WCM, comes from the *[form][19]* of music: the way the music is structured.
Sonatas, fugues, polonaises, mazurkas are all different forms of music, and differ
primarily in the kind of melody, the meter and the way ideas are developed as the
piece progresses. It is interesting to note that over time these forms have become
more relaxed, and composers started straying away from forms more. For example,
if one listens to the Beethoven piano sonatas in chronological order, one can
make out that while the first movements of most of his early sonatas stuck close
to the [Sonata-allegro][20] form, his later sonatas were much more free-form.

> **M**: I didn't say that they improv. I said that wcm allows freedom in that sense and in tempo, while HCM doesn't. On the other hand, hcm allows freedom of improv while performing, whereas wcm doesn't

> **M**: Yes  
> **M**: For example HCM performers seldom stray away from the scale too much, and they usually stick to a strict tempo. Wcm composers don't (remember the [Harmonic Labyrinth][8] from geb?)  
> **S**: I like to think of another major difference as breadth vs depth  
> **A**: What do you mean  
> **M**: ?  
> **S**: as in, WCM has breadth: works are typically polyphonic, with the emphasis on how the sound is built up by the various parts/voices/instruments that comprise it more than a single melody  
> **S**: but HCM has depth: a single *rāga* or mood is explored very thoroughly by a single voice/part  
> **S**: and, of course, this means standalone melodies have more importance  
> **M**: But that's done in wcm too! (Remind me to give you an accelerated course through the Beethoven sonatas when I come there)  
> **S**: (but that's done in HCM too! look at all of film music)  
> **A**: In rare compositions that [straying away from a scale] does happen. E.g. *[Surat Piyā Ki][9]* and *jugalbandi* where another performer takes the first one's *pa* as their *sā*  
> **S**: i.e. *jasrangi jugalbandi*  

close 2017-09-20T04:31:00Z

In the linked *Surat Piyā Ki* clip, the first shift is at 0:47, and then they
just keep coming every 20 seconds or so until the end. Other pieces exhibiting
*rāga* shifts are *rāgamālā*s and a number of semi-classical *nātyageet*
(musical drama) piece. However, those are pieces
constructed for that purpose; a different example is the phenomenon of *vivādi*
notes in HCM performances, where a note not belonging to a scale is artfully
used to increase the aesthetic appeal, or *murchhanā*, where the notes of the
scale stay the same but the tonic/*sā* is temporarily shifted to give the effect
of a different scale. *Jasrangi jugalbandi* is a duet performance in a similar
vein with a shift of a fifth/*sā-pa bhāv* persisting throughout. Of course,
these are very common in WCM.

> **S**: yes, and a lot more "base framework" too (which as Aalok said doesn't change usually between performers and performances)  
> **M**: Well yea, but concertos are basically written so that there is an orchestra, but one single instrument is "the star". So in a piano concerto, there'll be tons of solo piano passages with bare to none accompaniment

> **S**: the primary focus is interaction between melodic voices  
> **S**: even when you say "solo piano" it's not like you're pressing one key at a time

Only later did we find out that the "depth vs. breadth" distinction is more
precisely stated as HCM tending to be "modal music", with a really large number
of non-Western modes, while WCM is "tonal music", as outlined [here][12]. (In
fact, beyond just modes, HCM associates emotions, times of the day, seasons,
etc. with the *rāga*s too, whereas WCM scales have broader mood associations
and, more pertinently, differ in their acoustic
properties on different instruments.)
But as we said, the topic of where the freedom and creativity lies in the two
bodies of music, and how the music is built up, definitely deserves more study.
