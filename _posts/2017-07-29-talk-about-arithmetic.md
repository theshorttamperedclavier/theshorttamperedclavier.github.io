title: "Talk About Arithmetic"
---

I thought arithmetic expressions in English were fairly consistent everywhere;
'five plus two' is 'seven', 'three times three' is 'nine', 'six into two' is
'twelve'... wait, back up. "Into? Who even says that? And shouldn't it mean
division?" Huh. Strangely, everyone I talked to who had learned arithmetic in
India had no issues with 'into', treating it unambiguously as multiplication,
but the construction was something weird to my American peers. And I saw a
similar thing happen with 'by': 'four by two' was variously interpreted as 'two'
and 'eight', with each party thinking the other was absurd.

(Note: in this post, whenever I mention "friends from India", I usually mean
people from a very similar socio-economic background as me who mostly lived in
Pune; my "friends from America" are more diverse socially and geographically.)

What is going on? How widespread is this phenomenon? What factors have an
influence? How can I investigate this? (I love those moments when I can sound
all sciencey.) Time for a quick survey. (**insert link**)

Some other interesting tidbits I noticed after I became aware of the 'into'/'by'
thing:
 * Among most people from India (and maybe elsewhere), students 'give' tests and
   teachers 'take' tests, but in America, teachers 'give' tests and students
   'take' them. Perhaps the reason is that in many Indian languages, like Hindi,
   Marathi, and Tamil, test taking/giving is literally expressed as 'giving' on
   the students' side and 'taking' on the teachers' side.
 * A friend from MathILy-Er from China writes fractions by first drawing the
   line, then writing the denominator, and finally writing the numerator. Most
   other people I've seen write it top to bottom. From a linguistic perspective,
   Mandarin fractions are expressed as 'F N D' where 'F' is the word for
   'fraction', 'N' is the numerator, and 'D' is the denominator; in English it's
   'N F D'.
 * The same friend often names his variables *k, t, p*, and when I asked him
   about it, said he would never naturally consider sequences like *a, b, c, d*
   or *k, l, m, n* or *p, q, r, s* which many native speakers of English find
   natural.
